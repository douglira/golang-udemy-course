# Go CLI:
  - go build -> Compiles a bunch of go source code files
  - go run -> Compiles and executes one or two files
  - go fmt -> Formats all the code in each file in the current directory
  - go install -> Compiles and "installs" a package (handle dependencies)
  - go get -> Downloads the raw source code of someone else's package (handle dependecies)
  - go test -> Runs any tests associated with the current project

# Type Packages into Go:
  - Executable -> Generates a file that we can run. Ex: 'package main' to make an executable type package.
    The main package must have a function called 'main';
  - Reusable -> Code used as 'helpers'. Good place to put reusable logic
